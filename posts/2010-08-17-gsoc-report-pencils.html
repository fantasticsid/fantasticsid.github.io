    <p><span>In a few hours this year’s <span>GSoC</span> coding period shall come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me say this experience is really fantastic. I’ve implemented jingle file transfer and XTLS encryption during the coding period. And hopefully these will be merged with the default branch soon. The community members are always asking students to give <span>feedbacks</span> to improve the program. The problem is, you just can’t do this effectively if you haven’t experienced something better :-) . (Some of the multi-developer projects I’ve participated do not even rely on revision control system.) But anyway, here are some thoughts:</span></p>
<p><span>My biggest wish is to make <span>gsoc</span> timeline more flexible so as to suit more students from countries other than the US. (I know this is really hard and might introduce numerous administrative tasks.) Summer holidays in different regions might have different start time and span and it’s really no easy job keeping up the progress if you multi-task. What the students can do should not be compromised just because they live outside the US.</span></p>
<p><span>The project that I worked on has well written source code and documentation and comments. But it still requires a lot of hacking, poking around, debugging for a new developer to get familiar with the code base. And that limits the number of developers that could potentially contribute to the project. I think setting up wiki pages to explain how existing code works  (how certain events are handled, how to add new callbacks, the structure of existing classes etc.) should be adopted as a regular practice. Gajim has got a wiki, but it is not used most effectively, perhaps due to the change of code over the years, which transformed the code into a new structure, leaving the wiki obsolete. Perhaps we should consider seriously adding wiki page update into the normal developing cycle. But again, I don’t know how much burden that would bring to developers.</span></p>
<p><span>I must thank my mentor Yann Leboulanger, for giving me a lot of pragmatic advices, being patient during the time I dealt with school coursework and accepting me as a gsoc student in the first place. I also got help from the XMPP software foundation, a welcoming community, which hosted weekly meetings and also generously sent me books to help get things done. Last but not least, I thank Google, for being an awesome company, for its commitment in open source, and I wish you good luck in the war against Oracle.</span></p>
