    <p>This morning I received google’s email saying that I’ve been accepted as a summer of code student this year! As I said before I shall regularly update my progress on this blog. In the exuberance of joy I now want to blog about some general information regarding this year’s gsoc and my own project.</p>
<h3 id="general-information-about-gsoc-2010">General information about gsoc 2010</h3>
<p>Although called summer of code, the program was actually announced way earlier than the start of summer on 8th February when the temperature sometimes drops below the freezing point. Surely if you’re a student you could start 5-6 weeks later when the list of mentoring organizations has been published but at that time you would probably be busy with your courses at school. The application process lasts for about 1 month.</p>
<p>This year a total number of 1025 students are accepted to participate in the program. <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010">Here</a> is the list of all accepted projects. The coding period begins on 24th May. Some students are already asking how many students from their countries are accepted. We will soon get that information from google’s opensource blog.</p>
<h3 id="about-my-project">About my project</h3>
<p>My gsoc project is “Jingle File Transfer and XTLS support for gajim”. <a href="http://www.gajim.org/">Gajim</a> is an open source <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">jabber</a> instant messaging client written in python. As the project’s title suggests this is really a two-part project. I will be reading documentation, talking to the community members and diving into the source code for the next month. I will experiment with libraries I will use (farsight, libice, tls…). I am sure this experience will be an invaluable one.</p>
<p>The community members from jabber and gajim are all very kind. Prior to the program I didn’t know my mentor Yann Leboulanger. It is gsoc that teaches me how to talk to the community, contribute to the community and later establish yourself as a developer in open source community. In this sense open source means more than just open access to the source code, but more importantly, a welcoming community.</p>
